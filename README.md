# trees-please

We were inspired by an ideation exercise as part of the [Gray Area Creative Code Immersive](https://grayarea.org/learn/immersive/) to create an interactive map that would connect a visitor to a nearby tree in San Francisco.

We used [D3](https://d3js.org/) and the [Mapbox web services API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/) to manipulate [a dataset of trees](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Tree-List/tkzw-k3nq) from DataSF and plot the trees on a map. When a visitor activates their location, they are given walking directions to a random tree, along with the name of the tree and a photo.



**Potential Future Feature Ideas**

- Tree photo matches the type of tree
- Filter by type of tree
- Limit random tree by a distance threshold
